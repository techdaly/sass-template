        <p class="blog-body">Today I interviewed some people about why rocks are so cool.</p>
        <p class="quote">"I don't know if you knew this about rocks, but rocks don't breathe. Rocks are, um, cool. Uh. What could I say about rocks? There are sedimentary rocks. There are metamorphic rocks. Rocks are made from lava which is pretty metal. But not like metal, like, metal. Rocks are cool. You can eat them. Chickens do. Rock salt! It's called rock salt."
